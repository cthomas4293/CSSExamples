Flex Box

flex box - a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.

There are two types of properties: 

Container Properties: adjustments made to the flex CONTAINER.

   flex-direction - specifies how items are placed in the flex container, defining the main axis and its direction.

   justify-content - Defines how space is diestributed between items in flex container ALONG THE MAIN AXIS.

   flex-wrap - specifies whether items are forced into a single line OR can be wrapped into multiple lines.

   align-items - Defines how space is distributd between items in flex container ALONG THE CROSS AXIS (opposite of justify content).
   note* flex-stretch will make item fill area along cross axis

   align-content - Defines how space is distrributed BETWEEN ROWS in flex container ALONG THE COROSS AXIS.



Flex Item Properties: adjustments made to the ITEMS in the flex container.

   order - specifies the order used to lay out item in thier flex container. (the default value is 0 for every flex item)

   Three values: flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis
   * the first value passed in with a unit will convert from flex... to flex-basis.
   ex. flex: 2 2 10%
   {
   flex-grow - dictates how the unused space should be spread amonst flex items. (all based on ratios of UNALOCATED space)

   flex-shrink - dicates how items should srink when there isn't enough space in container. (all based on ratios of UNALOCATED space)

   flex-basis - sort of like width, but not. specifies the ideal size of a flex item BEFORE it's placed into a flex container. ideal means if its too big it will correctly size them to fit.
   }

   align-self - allows you to override align-items, on individal flex items.
   
   
  EXAMPLES -
  
  for vertical and horizontally centered flex items (
   justify content - center
   align-items - center
  )
