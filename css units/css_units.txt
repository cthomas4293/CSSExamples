CSS Units:
Relative units      Absolute units
-EM                  -PX
-REM                 -ETC
-VH
-VW
-%
-ETC

% - percentages are always relative to some other value.
ex: width: 50% - half of the width of the parent element.
line-height is the percentage of the font-size of the element itself.

EM - With font size, 1em equals the font size of the parent. 2 ems is twice the font size of the parent.
With other properties it is equal to the computed font size of the element itself.
(also note that EM's when nested elements are used will scale quickly and out of control. In this case use REM's)
(best to use when you have a specific situation where you need to scale relative to the parent or some other elements units for responsiveness)

REM - Relative to the root elements font size. Often easier to work with.
If the root font size is 20px, 1 rem is always 20px, 2rem is always 40px.
(the html elements default font size is 16px)
(best to use rems for font sizes because of its responsiveness)

WHAT SHOULD I USE AND WHEN?

px - Avoid for font sizes. use px for small detail like borders and shadows.

rem/ em - use for font sizes and often margin/ padding.

% - use for defining layouts and widths.

vh/ vw - larger layout concerns.
